The work presented here was carried out as a part of the 15-day hackathon 'Capture the Bug' organised by NIELIT Calicut, Vyoma Systems and VSD. I am greatly indebted to Kunal Ghosh, Lavanya, Professor Sreejesh, Sumanto Kar and the entire Team for this great learning experience and immense guidance provided throughout the hackathon.
