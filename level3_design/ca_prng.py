# Fast and simple ca_prng conformant cellular automata model in
# Python. This model is actually implented as a general 1D CA class
# and the rule and size of the CA array is provided as parameters.

# class CellularAutomata()
# 
# This class implements a 1D cellular automata. The class expects
# to be initalized with an array of arbitrary length with initial
# cell state values (0 or 1) as well as an array with update rules.
# 
# The update rule is expected to contain eight values (0 or 1)
# that define the update value for a cell given by the current
# state of the cell and two nearest neighbours. Note that nearest
# neighbour is calculated with wrap around, that is the cell
# array is treated as a ring.
